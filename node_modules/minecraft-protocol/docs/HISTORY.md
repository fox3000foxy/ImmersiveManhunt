 * createServers's beforePing option can now takes an async function
 * enable compression by default in createServer

 * Server clients have a new property, client.profile, containing the result

 * Add keepAlive option to createServer, in order to optionally disable it.
 * Lots of low-level changes to allow minecraft-data to be more generic.
 * NMP code is able to work with both 1.8 and 1.9 data with the same code,
   opening a path for cross-versioning.
 * The packet events now take two parameters : `function (packetData, packetMetadata)`
   * `packetMetadata` contains the packet name, id and state (more may be added later)
   * `packetData` contains the actual data content

## 0.14.0

 * Huge rewrite of the internals, using transform streams, which eliminates two
   classes of problems from node-minecraft-protocol :
   * Uncatchable errors being triggered inside the protocol parser
   * Packets ariving out of order, causing several race conditions
 * All the attributes that were previously exposed via `mc.protocol` are now directly
   attached to the `mc` object, e.g. `mc.protocol.states` => `mc.states`. This is
   prone to further changes.
 * open_window now reports the entityId correctly for horses
 * Properly handle the set_compression packet
 * Fix small bug in scoreboard_team and player_info packets causing crashes
 * Fix the login implementation logging out people from their launchers.

## 0.13.4

 * Lots of changes in how some formats are handled.

 * writing packets is 6% faster (thanks [Matt Bell](https://github.com/mappum))

## 0.7.9

 * support minecraft protocol 1.5 / protocol version 60 (thanks [Matt Bell](https://github.com/mappum))

## 0.7.8

 * server: ability to change `motd` and `maxPlayers`
 * server: fix incorrect `playerCount`

## 0.7.7

 * server: fix crash when client disconnects quickly

## 0.7.6

 * onlineModeExceptions are all lowercase now. fixes security hole.

## 0.7.5

 * server: add `onlineModeExceptions`. When server is in:
   - online mode: these usernames are exempt from online mode.
   - offline mode: these usernames must authenticate.

## 0.7.4

 * server: online mode: don't log in client until username verification

## 0.7.3

 * revert removing socket delays to reduce latency as it was causing
   errors and test failures.

## 0.7.2

## 0.7.1

 * remove socket delays to reduce latency. (thanks [Matt Bell](https://github.com/mappum))

## 0.7.0

 * `createServer`: rename `encryption-enabled` option to `encryption` to stay
   consistent with the examples. (thanks [Robin Lambertz](https://github.com/roblabla))
 * `createClient`: don't require both `email` and `username`.
   - The `username` and `password` arguments are used to authenticate with the
     official minecraft servers and determine the case-correct username. If
     you have migrated your user account to a mojang login, `username` looks
     like an email address.
   - If you leave out the `password` argument, `username` is used to connect
     directly to the server. In this case you will get kicked if the server is
     in online mode.

## 0.6.7

Emit 'error' event instead of crashing when other computers abuse the
minecraft protocol.

Big thanks to [Robin Lambertz](https://github.com/roblabla) for this release.
